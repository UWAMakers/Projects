# Projects

Our group develops a number of exciting projects each year as part of our mission to bring a "Maker Culture" to the University and states student population. Typically, we have a number of different types of projects. These include:

- Individual Projects;
- Community Projects;
- Research Projects; and
- Academic Projects.

This repository is used to host promotional information (typically blogs) about the projects we are workign on as a group. We also use this repository to develop new ideas for future projects.
